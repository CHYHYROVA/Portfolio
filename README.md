# Portfolio

This is the Portfolio of Manual QA Natalia Chyhyrova.



# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Natalia Chyhyrova

I recently completed a **Manual QA course** at QA Vision (March â€“ July 2025), where I studied software testing, API testing, and SQL for QA.

This repository contains examples of practical tasks completed during my QA training. The main focus is on **API testing** and **SQL queries** used in quality assurance.

---

## ðŸ”¹ API Testing
- Used **Postman** to create and execute requests
- Worked with HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
- Verified status codes, response bodies, and headers
- Created test scenarios and parameterized requests
- Included both positive and negative test cases

---

## ðŸ”¹ SQL for QA
- Wrote basic queries: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`
- Queried test databases to validate data
- Used SQL to check data integrity
- Focused on practical applications of SQL in QA tasks

---

## ðŸ“Ž Portfolio Goal
To demonstrate essential skills for a **Junior QA** role, with a focus on API testing and database validation.
